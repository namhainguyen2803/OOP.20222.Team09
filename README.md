## Introduction
The project "Visualization of Operations on Tree Data Structures" aims to design a program that allows users to visualize and understand basic operations on different types of trees. In the project, we aim to create a software visualizer that can provide clear visual representations and detailed explanations for operations such as creating a tree, inserting nodes, deleting nodes, updating nodes, and traversing the tree. This helps users understand the process and purpose of each operation.
